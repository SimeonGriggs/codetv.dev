## The tech industry can feel unwelcoming.

There are a lot of things about tech that frustrate me.

I don't like that we've let algorithmic engagement drive us toward FoMO and hot takes. I don't like that we've slipped into clique-ish behavior where we turn technical choices into identities.

I don't like that so many people I talk to feel lonely and disconnected. I don't like how much pressure people feel to know everything. I don't like that so many talented folks end up burning out.

## We can make the tech industry better together.

I've bet my whole career on my belief that I'm not the only one who wants this industry to be more playful, more collaborative, more joyful.
